This program calculates the tetrahedral order parameter from a molecular dynamics trajectory.

THIS PROGRAM HAS NOT BEEN THOROUGHLY TESTED!!!

Current limitations include:
* Input files must be in the .xtc format from the GROMACS simulation package.

The following libraries are required:
* The Boost program_options library.
* The Armadillo matrix library.
* The xdrfile library for reading GROMACS trajectory files.
